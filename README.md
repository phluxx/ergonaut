# phlirc

An IRCv3 IRC Client written specifically to support the features of the [Ergo IRCd](https://github.com/ergochat/ergo).

This IRC Client will not be intended to support IRC Networks which are not using Ergo IRCd. As such, use on networks such as Libera Chat will not be officially supported.

This will be the foundation for the future [Verbabble](https://www.verbabble.com/) Client.

This will utilize the Flutter framework.
